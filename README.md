Dashboard for accessing economic data in R Shiny.

During the various estimates of the Sector Accounts and Balance of Payments (Sectorrekeningen en Betalingsbalans; SRBB) for the quarters and years, 
the Dashboard is an important tool. It provides insight into the figures during the various phases of an estimate at various levels of detail and
intersections.

The previous version of the dashboard showed the data in a (large) Excel file, fetching its data from the CBS SQL server.
The current version of the dashboard is designed to show the data via a R Shiny app, while implementing various changes to 
make the dashboard faster, and offering more features, such as data visualisation.
